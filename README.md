## AngularJs Assignment
**_PROBLEM STATEMENT_** : Create a form in AngularJs, add five different fields. Perform validation, sort and search operations.

 
I have used ng-click event to handle the click button.
$touched and $error flags are used for the validation for some of the input fields. 
Using novalidate with a form declaration disables any browser-specific validation. 
After clicking the submit button the data is stored in a MySQL Database and again retrieved from there and displayed in a table for sort and search operations.
The storing and retrieving of the data is performed using php.
